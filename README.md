## Models

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

CNNs are a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.

### Residual Network (ResNet)

ResNet is a type of artificial neural network that builds on constructs known from pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. ResNet is a short name for a residual network, and as the name suggests, it utilizes residual blocks to make the training of deep networks easier.
